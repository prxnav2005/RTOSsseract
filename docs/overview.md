# MicroBlaze Overview

## Introduction

MicroBlaze is a 32-bit soft processor core designed by Xilinx for use in FPGA designs. It is a highly configurable RISC-based processor that can be tailored to meet specific application requirements.

## Key Features

- **RISC Architecture**: Uses a load/store Harvard architecture.
- **Configurable Pipeline**: Can be a 3-stage or 5-stage pipeline.
- **Cache Support**: Includes instruction and data cache for performance optimization.
- **Memory Management**: Optional MMU for running operating systems.
- **AXI and PLB Support**: Can interface with peripherals via AXI Interconnect or PLB (older designs).
- **Hardware Multiplier & FPU**: Supports optional integer multiplier, barrel shifter, and floating-point unit.
- **Interrupt Controller**: Supports external and internal interrupts.
- **Custom Instructions**: Allows hardware acceleration using user-defined instructions.

## Use Cases

- Embedded systems within FPGA designs.
- Running RTOS like FreeRTOS or standalone applications.
- Networking applications.
- Industrial control and automation.
- Image processing and data acquisition.
