# Inter-Task Communication in RTOS

## Introduction
In an RTOS, tasks often need to communicate or synchronize with each other. Inter-Task Communication (ITC) mechanisms allow tasks to share data safely and coordinate execution.

## Methods of Inter-Task Communication

### 1. **Message Queues**
   - Used to send messages between tasks.
   - FIFO-based (First In, First Out).
   - Suitable for data transfer when order matters.

   **Example Use Case:**  
   A sensor task collects data and sends it to a processing task.

### 2. **Semaphores**
   - Used for **synchronization** and **resource management**.
   - **Binary Semaphore** (like a lock) ensures mutual exclusion.
   - **Counting Semaphore** allows multiple resources to be shared.

   **Example Use Case:**  
   A UART driver task signals an application task when new data is received.

### 3. **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)**
   - Prevents multiple tasks from accessing shared resources simultaneously.
   - Priority Inheritance mechanism avoids priority inversion.

   **Example Use Case:**  
   A task writing to an SD card locks the resource using a mutex.

### 4. **Event Flags**
   - Allows tasks to wait for multiple conditions before proceeding.
   - More efficient than polling.

   **Example Use Case:**  
   A network task waits for an event flag before sending data.

### 5. **Pipes and FIFOs**
   - Streams data between tasks (like a software-based UART).
   - More efficient for continuous data flow.

   **Example Use Case:**  
   An audio processing task receives real-time data from a microphone driver.

## Choosing the Right ITC Mechanism
| Mechanism       | Use Case Example                        | Pros                         | Cons                         |
|----------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Message Queue  | Task-to-task data transfer    | Ordered, buffered messages   | Overhead in queue management |
| Semaphore      | Synchronization, resource lock | Simple, efficient            | No data transfer capability  |
| Mutex         | Shared resource protection     | Avoids corruption            | Risk of priority inversion  |
| Event Flags   | Multi-condition synchronization | Low CPU usage                | Limited to binary signals   |
| Pipes/FIFOs   | Streaming data                 | Continuous data handling     | Requires careful buffering  |

## Conclusion
Inter-task communication is essential for building an efficient RTOS-based system. Selecting the right method depends on **latency, data size, and task priority**. 

In my project, I have used:
- **Message Queues** for peripheral data exchange.
- **Semaphores/Mutexes** for managing shared resources.
- **Event Flags** for signaling between tasks.
