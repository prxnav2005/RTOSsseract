# Memory and Peripherals in RTOS

## Memory Management in RTOS

RTOS-based systems require efficient memory management to handle multiple tasks, stacks, and dynamic memory allocations. 

### Types of Memory Management
1. **Static Allocation**  
   - Memory is assigned at compile-time.
   - Used for time-critical applications where memory allocation delays are unacceptable.

2. **Dynamic Allocation**  
   - Memory is assigned at runtime.
   - Useful for applications with variable memory requirements but may introduce fragmentation.

3. **Stack Management**  
   - Each task has its own stack to maintain execution context.
   - Stack overflows can be detected using guard bands.

### Memory Protection
- **Memory Protection Unit (MPU)**: Provides memory isolation between tasks.
- **Heap Management**: Used for dynamic memory allocation (e.g., `pvPortMalloc()` in FreeRTOS).
- **Shared Memory**: Allows communication between tasks and peripherals.

## Peripheral Management in RTOS

RTOS manages hardware peripherals efficiently to ensure deterministic performance.

### Peripheral Communication Methods
1. **Polling**  
   - CPU continuously checks a peripheral for data.
   - Simple but inefficient as CPU is busy-waiting.

2. **Interrupt-Driven I/O**  
   - Peripheral signals an interrupt when data is ready.
   - Improves efficiency by allowing the CPU to execute other tasks.

3. **DMA (Direct Memory Access)**  
   - Transfers data between peripherals and memory without CPU intervention.
   - Used for high-speed data transfers.

### Common Peripherals in RTOS
- **Timers**: Used for task scheduling, timeouts, and delays.
- **UART, SPI, I2C**: Serial communication interfaces for external devices.
- **GPIO**: General-purpose input/output for sensors, LEDs, buttons.
- **Ethernet/Wi-Fi**: For networking applications.

## Summary
- RTOS memory management ensures reliable task execution with stack and heap allocation.
- Efficient peripheral handling via interrupts and DMA minimizes CPU overhead.
- Proper management improves real-time performance and system stability.
