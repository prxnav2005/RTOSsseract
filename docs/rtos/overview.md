# RTOS Overview

## What is an RTOS?
A **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)** is an operating system designed to handle tasks with strict timing constraints. Unlike general-purpose OS (Windows, Linux), an RTOS prioritizes **deterministic** execution, ensuring tasks run within a predictable time frame.

## Why Use an RTOS on FPGA?
Running an RTOS on an FPGA-based soft core like MicroBlaze enables:  
 - Real-time processing for embedded applications.  
 - Efficient resource management for multiple concurrent tasks.  
 - Hardware acceleration using FPGA peripherals.  
 - Improved system responsiveness and reliability.  

## Key Characteristics of an RTOS
- **Deterministic Scheduling**: Tasks are executed within strict time constraints.  
- **Task Prioritization**: Higher-priority tasks preempt lower-priority ones.  
- **Concurrency Management**: Supports multitasking and synchronization mechanisms (e.g., semaphores, mutexes).  
- **Low Latency**: Ensures minimal delay for critical operations.  
- **Scalability**: Can be optimized for different applications, from simple embedded devices to complex industrial control systems.  

## RTOS vs General-Purpose OS

| Feature            | RTOS (FreeRTOS, Zephyr)  | General OS (Linux, Windows) |
|--------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Priority**       | Deterministic execution | Best-effort execution       |
| **Multitasking**   | Yes (real-time tasks)   | Yes (preemptive)            |
| **Latency**        | Low (microseconds)      | Higher (milliseconds)       |
| **Resource Usage** | Low (optimized)        | High (complex applications) |

## Use Cases of RTOS on FPGA
- **Embedded control systems** (automotive, robotics).  
- **Industrial automation** (real-time monitoring, PLCs).  
- **Medical devices** (pacemakers, infusion pumps).  
- **IoT and networking** (low-power, high-reliability systems).
